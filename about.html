      <p id= "description">

        I have always been in love with the arts and found my roots in traditional mediums.
        During high school, I was introduced to graphic design and the Adobe Suite, quickly
        finding a new passion. However, my interest in mathematics and logic pulled me in a different
         direction. I had originally wanted to become an Architect in hopes that I could combine my
          creative and logic skills. So, I completed my first year at Carleton in the History and
           Theory of Architecture program. <br><br>
        It was during this year that I took an Introduction to Computers for the Arts and Social Sciences
         class, which allowed me to become familiar with Python. I was more
         fascinated with Pythonâ€™s drawing capabilities and found that my original goal of
          applying both creative and logic skills could be accomplished through coding.<br></br>
        I switched over to IMD, and became fascinated by the world of multimedia, technology, and user experience. I also found joy in
        designing mockups or concepts for applications/web pages that seem to come to life when paired with an
        element of interaction. With my studies, I hope to continue finding ways to improve my
         designs in a more intuitive and creative way.
