        This interactive space was designed for the Nature Live Gallery in the Canadian Museum of Nature. As part of a group project from a Human Computer Interaction class, this interactive space tackles the challenge of providing more of an interactive experience for museum goers.
        <br><br>
        The idea is that users would spawn a bug using the controls on the floor and interact with it, while also learning facts about it that would appear on screen. After a certain amount of time, the environment would switch, providing a new set of bugs to spawn.

      <h1>The Design</h1>
      <p>The wall portion of the design is split up into two areas: the environment area and the information area. The environment area is where the bugs will appear and react to the user’s movements. The information area to the right is divided by the different bugs that can be spawned, which contains counters for each bug type on screen as well as some interesting facts.</p>
      <br><br>
      <p>The floor portion of the design is also split into two: an interaction zone and a spawning area. Users must step into the interaction zone to interact with the bugs. The spawning area also has buttons that users can step on to spawn the bugs. </p>
      <br><br>
      <p>This design is catered towards families with young kids, who prefer interacting with displays using their bodies. </p>

        <h1>The Process</h1>
        <p>To get to the final design, we started with observational research. We went to the museum on one of its more busy days and people-watched for the evening in the Nature Live Gallery. We felt that there was an opportunity for goers to get a better interaction with the bug displays and thought an interactive space would be a good solution. This would also provide another attraction for a large portion of the museum’s audience: kids. </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>Each member of the group sketched out design ideas and we pout together a low-fi prototype to use for a cognitive walkthrough. Unfortunately, we could only test with our family members, but we got good feedback; our design started with three walls (the third wall was entirely dedicated to information), which mainly confused our participants. So, we merged it with the environment wall. Additionally, the interactive zone wasn’t very clear, so we added lights to it.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>From there, we created a medium-fi prototype and used the wizard of oz method to test our design. Our design still has some flaws with regards to our participants not understanding how to interact with the bugs, but we feel that this may have been because of our limited prototype. </p>
